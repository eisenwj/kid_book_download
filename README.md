# kid_book_download
To download kidbook from publisher --老连环画-- on wechat

Usually it's all webp or jpg pictures, sometimes png, current version will turn all of them to jpg and save to a temp folder, then compose them into a docx file with template -- 01_模板.docx
All pictures in docx will be center, and horizon orientation. 
But still can't read text and put text inside -- fortunately, there's not so much kid books in that format. 
Will update later


File:
1_模板.docx -- should put in C:\Temp\Print\小人书

kid_book_downloader.py -- the run file -- python kid_book_downloader.py 

Directory --
default download/work directory is -- C:\Temp\Movie\downthemall -- But it can change while running.
